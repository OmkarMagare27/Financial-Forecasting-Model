### **README: Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM and ARIMA**

This repository provides a comprehensive approach to time series forecasting, specifically focusing on stock prices using a hybrid model of **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)** models. 

### **Project Overview**
This project integrates the deep learning capabilities of LSTM for capturing complex, non-linear patterns in stock price movements with the statistical strengths of ARIMA for modeling linear relationships and residual errors. The hybrid approach combines the benefits of both models to enhance the overall predictive accuracy.

### **Purpose of the Project**
The goal of this project is to forecast stock prices by first using LSTM to make predictions and then refining those predictions using ARIMA to correct residual errors. This combined method can lead to more accurate and reliable forecasts in financial markets.

### **Features**
1. **LSTM for Time-Series Forecasting**: The LSTM model captures long-term dependencies and patterns in time-series data, making it well-suited for stock price prediction.
2. **ARIMA for Error Correction**: ARIMA is applied to the errors generated by the LSTM predictions, allowing for further refinement of the forecast.
3. **Data Preprocessing and Partitioning**: Data is preprocessed, cleaned, and split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. **Multiple Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are calculated to assess model performance.
5. **Visualization**: Various visualizations such as actual vs. predicted values, errors, and performance metrics are provided to help interpret the model's results.

### **How It Works**
1. **Data Loading**: Stock price data (adjusted close prices) is loaded from a CSV file, cleaned, and transformed for time series analysis.
   
2. **LSTM Model**:
   - The LSTM model is designed to predict future stock prices based on a sequence of past prices.
   - It uses TensorFlow's Keras library and consists of LSTM and Dense layers.
   - The model is trained using the training data, and predictions are made on both the training and test sets.

3. **ARIMA Model**:
   - After the LSTM model makes its predictions, ARIMA is applied to the residual errors.
   - ARIMA helps capture any linear trends or patterns that the LSTM model may have missed.
   - The ARIMA model is fitted to the residual errors and makes predictions to adjust the LSTM model's output.

4. **Final Predictions**:
   - The final forecast is generated by combining the LSTM predictions with ARIMA’s error corrections.
   - The final output is visualized alongside the actual stock prices to compare the performance of the hybrid model.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The performance of the model is evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and MAE metrics, which quantify how close the predicted values are to the actual values.

### **Key Components**
#### **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. This makes it suitable for stock price prediction, as the model can retain important information from past prices over time. LSTM consists of various components like memory cells, input gates, forget gates, and output gates, which help manage the flow of information and retain important patterns.

#### **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**
ARIMA is a popular statistical method for time-series forecasting that focuses on linear relationships within the data. The model uses autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to predict future values. In this project, ARIMA is used for error correction by modeling the residuals of the LSTM predictions.

### **Data**
The project uses stock price data, including the opening, closing, high, low, and adjusted closing prices along with the volume. The primary focus is on the adjusted closing prices, which reflect a more accurate representation of a stock's value after corporate actions such as dividends and stock splits.

### **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **LSTM Model**: The LSTM model is trained on historical stock prices, using a sequence of `n` previous days to predict the next day's price. The model’s architecture includes LSTM layers to capture sequential patterns and Dense layers to refine the prediction.
  
- **ARIMA Model**: After the LSTM model predicts stock prices, the ARIMA model is trained on the residual errors between the actual and predicted values. ARIMA helps adjust the predictions by accounting for any linear dependencies the LSTM model missed.

- **Hybrid Approach**: The final prediction combines the LSTM's non-linear forecasting capabilities with ARIMA's linear corrections, producing more accurate stock price predictions.

### **Project Explanation for an Interview**
If asked about this project during an interview:
- **Goal**: The main goal of this project is to forecast stock prices using a hybrid approach combining LSTM and ARIMA models. The LSTM model captures complex, non-linear patterns in stock price movements, while the ARIMA model focuses on correcting residual errors in the LSTM’s predictions.
- **Why LSTM**: LSTM is chosen due to its ability to remember long-term dependencies in time series data. It is particularly well-suited for financial forecasting where past trends can influence future movements.
- **Why ARIMA**: ARIMA complements LSTM by addressing any linear relationships in the residuals that LSTM might not capture. This makes the overall forecast more accurate.
- **Hybrid Model**: The combination of LSTM and ARIMA results in a more robust forecasting model, capable of handling both complex patterns and simpler linear trends.

### **Conclusion**
The hybrid LSTM and ARIMA model presented in this project demonstrates how combining machine learning techniques with traditional statistical models can improve predictive accuracy in time series forecasting, especially for financial applications such as stock price prediction.

By following the steps in this repository, you can implement the hybrid forecasting model and explore its effectiveness in various time series data scenarios, such as predicting stock prices or other financial metrics.
